Here is a minimal static web app that displays "Hello World" in blue color and centered on the page. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all included inline.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World</title>
    <style>
        body {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
            height: 100vh;
            margin: 0;
            background-color: #f0f0f0;
        }
        h1 {
            color: blue;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="message">Hello World</h1>
    <script>
        // You can add any JavaScript functionality here if needed
        console.log("Page loaded and ready!");
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:
- **HTML Structure**: The document contains a single `<h1>` element that displays "Hello World".
- **CSS Styles**: The CSS styles center the content both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox. The background color is set to a light gray for contrast, and the text color is set to blue.
- **JavaScript**: A simple console log is included to indicate that the page has loaded. You can expand this section for more functionality if needed. 

You can copy and paste this code into an HTML file and open it in a web browser to see the result.
