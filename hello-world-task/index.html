Here's a minimal static web app that displays "Hello World" in blue color and centered on the page. The HTML includes inline CSS for styling and inline JavaScript, although the JavaScript is not strictly necessary for this simple task. However, it is included as per your request.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World</title>
    <style>
        body {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
            height: 100vh;
            margin: 0;
            background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Optional background color */
        }
        h1 {
            color: blue;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="greeting">Hello World</h1>

    <script>
        // This JavaScript is not necessary for the display, but included as per request
        document.getElementById('greeting').innerText = 'Hello World';
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:
- **HTML Structure**: The `<h1>` tag contains the text "Hello World".
- **CSS**: The CSS styles the body to use Flexbox for centering the content both vertically and horizontally. The text color is set to blue.
- **JavaScript**: The inline JavaScript updates the text of the `<h1>` element, although it is redundant in this case since the text is already set in the HTML.

You can copy this code into an HTML file and open it in a web browser to see the result.
