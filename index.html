Here's a minimal static web app that displays "Hello World" in blue color and centered on the page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The CSS is included inline to style the text, and the JavaScript is included inline as well, though it's not necessary for this simple example.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World</title>
    <style>
        body {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
            height: 100vh;
            margin: 0;
            background-color: #f0f0f0;
        }
        h1 {
            color: blue;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="greeting">Hello World</h1>

    <script>
        // This script is not necessary for the current functionality but included as per the brief
        document.getElementById('greeting').innerText = "Hello World";
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:
- The HTML structure includes a `<head>` section with metadata and a `<body>` section where the content is displayed.
- CSS styles are applied inline within the `<style>` tag to center the text both vertically and horizontally and to set the text color to blue.
- A simple JavaScript code is included to demonstrate inline scripting, although it currently does the same thing as the static HTML content.
